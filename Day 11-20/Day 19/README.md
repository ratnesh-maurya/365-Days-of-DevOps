# Show information about a specific Pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# View the logs of a specific Pod
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Display Deployments in the default namespace
kubectl get deployments

# Display Services in the default namespace
kubectl get services

# Apply a configuration from a file
kubectl apply -f <filename>

### Command Explanations:

1.  `kubectl get pods`

    -   Purpose: Retrieve a list of Pods within the default namespace.
    -   Explanation: This command provides an overview of the running Pods, their status, and other relevant information. Useful for monitoring the state of your deployed applications.
2.  `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`

    -   Purpose: Provide detailed information about a specific Pod.
    -   Explanation: This command offers a comprehensive view of the specified Pod, including its containers, events, and configuration details. Useful for troubleshooting and gaining insights into Pod behavior.
3.  `kubectl logs <pod-name>`

    -   Purpose: Display the logs of a specific Pod.
    -   Explanation: Retrieve real-time or historical logs from a Pod. This is crucial for debugging and understanding the behavior of your application within the containerized environment.
4.  `kubectl get deployments`

    -   Purpose: List Deployments within the default namespace.
    -   Explanation: Deployments manage the lifecycle of Pods, and this command provides an overview of the deployed applications. Useful for monitoring the health and status of your application deployments.
5.  `kubectl get services`

    -   Purpose: List Services within the default namespace.
    -   Explanation: Services enable communication between Pods. This command helps you understand the available communication channels and their configurations. Essential for networking within the Kubernetes cluster.
6.  `kubectl apply -f <filename>`

    -   Purpose: Deploy resources described in a configuration file.
    -   Explanation: Apply a set of Kubernetes resources (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.) defined in a YAML or JSON file. This is how you bring your applications and infrastructure to life within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Kubernetes Deployment File:

```

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-container
        image: your-docker-image:tag
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This Deployment file outlines the basic structure needed to deploy a simple application. Customize it based on your application's requirements, including environment variables, volumes, and more. Once the file is ready, use the `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` command to deploy your application to the Kubernetes cluster.
